## The Test

Using Object Oriented PHP programming, JS, JQuery, and CSS3 create an app that get data about a github account. The user will type a github username account and the app will need to use GitHub API to show the account information on the screen. 

What information should the app show? We'll leave it to you. You can show the whatever you deem important or interesting, and int the layout, whatever you think that will be pretty and functional. :wink: 

Remember to comment the code and commits preferably in english and write the project *README* which must contain the steps to install and run the app on a debian based linux machine (debian, ubuntu, etc).


### Some extras

- Use Materialize or Bootstrap
- Make an Ajax call
- Responsive, functional and beautiful design (UX)

*PS:* Even if you use the JS to show the data, Github's API must be called by the PHP (server side).
